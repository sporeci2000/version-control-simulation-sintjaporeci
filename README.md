# Project Reflection
To organize my project efficiently, I started by creating a new branch called `feature/header`. This allowed me to develop the header section of my website without affecting the main branch.  
I then created a HTML file with basic structure and then added and committed changes to the `index.html` file in this branch. Afterward, I created a `feature/footer` branch where I worked on the footer section and committed those changes as well.  
Next, I switched back to the `feature/header` branch and modified the footer content bycreating a footer tag to intentionally simulate a merge conflict. After completing those edits, I merged the `feature/footer` branch into `main` .   
Then, when I attempted to merge the `feature/header` branch into `main`, a conflict occurred due to overlapping changes in the `index.html` file. I manually edited `index.html` to resolve the merge conflict. I confirmed everything was clean using `git status`, and then pushed the updated main branch to GitHub.  
 I created a new branch named `review/main` from `main` and pushed it to GitHub. I used this branch to open a pull request, comparing changes in `main` with `review/main`. Since the branches were initially the same, I made a small edit in `main` to trigger a difference and submitted the pull request.  
 This entire experience emphasized the value of branching for separate feature development, the importance of resolving merge conflicts efficiently, and how pull requests serve as a crucial step for code review and collaboration.
